# portfolio_goodness
This portfolio will showcase the skills I learned during a high intensity web development bootcamp.

It will include at least three polished projects and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub.
One of the projects will be from a group effort to portray my ability to work effectively in a team environment.

The other projects will be my individual work to showcase what I can do on my own.
I will also include images and gifs of my projects to make it easier for anyone who wants to look at my portfolio.

Each project will include a live link and a GitHub link.

One of the projects will be written in OOP and one will feature a custom-built backend. The backend will consist of Node.js and MongoDB.

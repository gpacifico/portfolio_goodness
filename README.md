# Portfolio

This portfolio will showcase the skills I learned during a high intensity web development bootcamp.
It includes four recent projects and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub.

One of the projects is from a group effort to portray my ability to work effectively in a team environment.
The other projects are my individual work to showcase what I can do on my own.

Each project has an image, description, live link, and GitHub link.

One of the projects is written in OOP and another features a custom-built backend. The backend consists of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, 
and Passport.js.

There will also be sections in my portfolio that showcase my personality so you can see the person behind the projects.
